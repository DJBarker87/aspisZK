# Aspis

[![Spend integration](https://github.com/DJBarker87/aspis/actions/workflows/spend-integration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DJBarker87/aspis/actions/workflows/spend-integration.yml)

Aspis is a research implementation of a private spend on Solana. A user proves
that a private record can be spent under the pool's rules without publishing
the record, owner secret, value, or Merkle path. The program verifies the
proof, advances the pool, and records a one-time spent marker atomically: every
check and write succeeds together, or none of them do. The proof system does
not require a trusted setup ceremony.

The result is more than one transaction. The repository connects the
mathematical construction to Lean proofs, selected production Rust, a
byte-reproducible Solana program, and finalized mainnet evidence.

| Evidence layer | What is established | Primary record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mathematics in Lean | Substantial parts of the private-spend relation, concrete release calculations, algebra, hiding results, and maintained V5 component models are checked by Lean | [formal-verification overview](docs/formal-verification.md) and [`AspisFormal/`](AspisFormal/) |
| Selected Rust to Lean | Charon extracts selected production paths, Aeneas translates them, and Lean bridge proofs relate the generated definitions to the maintained models | [`aeneas-verif/`](aeneas-verif/) |
| Source to program bytes | A pinned clean source commit and pinned build tools reproduce the exact 1,258,496-byte V5 SBF | [V5 release preflight](release/preflight/v5-production-freeze.md) and [frozen candidate bundle](release/aspis-v5-tag67-frozen-candidate-v1/) |
| Program to chain | The deployed SBF identity, proof, statement, exact compute, state transition, and cleanup are preserved in a sanitized offline-verifiable bundle | [V5 mainnet bundle](release/aspis-v5-tag67-mainnet-v1/) |

These layers are complementary. A theorem about a model is not automatically a
theorem about every Rust instruction, and reproducible program bytes are not a
proof of their mathematics. Aspis records the links and their boundaries
instead of collapsing them into one broader claim.

## Mainnet result

On July 25, 2026 in Europe/Berlin (July 24 UTC), the current Aspis release
completed the full private-spend verification and state update on Solana
mainnet-beta. The finalized transaction:

- checked the complete 75,358-byte proof;
- advanced the pool state;
- created the one-time spent marker that prevents reuse; and
- consumed 1,334,452 of Solana's 1,400,000-unit transaction limit.

· [Check the release](release/aspis-v5-tag67-mainnet-v1/)
· [See formal coverage](docs/formal-verification.md)

The exact compiled program is tied to the recorded source and build
environment. The selected production verifier path is separately connected to
the maintained Lean models through the Charon/Aeneas proof layer.

### Exact technical record

| Item | Finalized V5 result |
| --- | --- |
| Verify-and-apply transaction | `EJviPgF…R3vJ2fE` |
| Finalized slot | `435019536` |
| Exact signed-wire simulation / landed compute | 1,334,452 CU / 1,334,452 CU |
| Transaction compute limit | 1,356,912 CU |
| Program | `7Q2nGsPg8rbjdxKHK4jxTgEWLTyd9o1X4KMSjCieRmue` |
| Nullifier | `7Umhkv2Z3E2DksnpivCz2tovtbRoL1uXtnYBAtQBgu8Q` |
| Canonical nullifier PDA bump | 255 |
| SBF | 1,258,496 bytes; SHA-256 `4cf3c1d5ddd47efa68875c0070247e007083c5c9bb2d5988db0d644a609edf40` |

The exact mainnet wire simulated and landed at the same compute value, leaving
22,460 CU below its transaction limit and 65,548 CU below Solana's maximum.
After finality, three separate cleanup transactions closed the retained proof
account and ProgramData, then swept the payer. The pinned refund recipient
`configured refund recipient` received
10,980,894,882 lamports in total, and the payer ended at zero. The
[V5 mainnet record](docs/v5-mainnet-demo.md) preserves the deployment,
execution, cleanup, and refund receipts.

## What has been formally checked

Aspis has two connected formal layers:

1. [`AspisFormal/`](AspisFormal/) checks the maintained mathematical
   development in Lean 4.
2. Charon, Aeneas, and additional Lean proofs connect selected production V5
   Rust paths to those models.

The current Rust-to-Lean coverage includes the selected Component-A release
schedule, Components B and C, the public output, the Tag-67 work-byte reads,
and the six ordered work checks. The combined theorem is
`FormalClosureStream1.current_source_combined_capstone`.

This is deliberately a bounded claim. It is not an end-to-end formal proof of
every Rust function, the compiler, Solana, or the complete private-spend
system. The Tag-67 connection retains one explicit hash-call equality premise:
the production transcript hash call must equal the Lean `HashFn` interface on
the transcript state and `DOM_GRIND || nonce_le64`. Cryptographic assumptions,
untranslated code, extraction, compilation, and runtime trust are listed in
the [assumptions ledger](docs/assumptions-ledger.md).

The [formal-verification overview](docs/formal-verification.md) gives the
precise theorem map, coverage, and remaining boundary.

## What the result demonstrates

Aspis shows that a transparent private-spend proof and its all-or-nothing pool
and spent-marker update can complete within one Solana transaction after the
proof has been uploaded and sealed. More distinctively, it publishes
separately checkable links from the mathematical model, through selected
production verifier paths, to exact compiled bytes and their finalized
mainnet execution.

The evidence does not turn those links into one universal theorem. The formal,
translation, compiler, runtime, and cryptographic boundaries remain explicit
at the point where each claim depends on them.

## What this release does not provide

- **Application scope.** V5 demonstrates one input, one output, and one
  sequential pool. It does not provide deposits, multiple inputs or outputs, a
  wallet, or a growing privacy set; the demonstrated anonymity set was one.
- **Throughput.** A pool processes spends sequentially, and proving plus
  proof-of-work grinding dominates latency. Horizontal scaling uses separate
  pools and therefore fragments anonymity.
- **Storage.** Each spend leaves one canonical nullifier account on-chain, so
  nullifier storage grows linearly.
- **Proof size and operations.** The proof needs 79 upload transactions before
  sealing. Temporary rent must be funded and later recovered.
- **Security model.** The arguments use named assumptions for Poseidon2,
  SHA-256, Fiat–Shamir, and knowledge extraction. Network metadata, timing,
  fee-payer linkage, transaction graphs, and physical side channels are
  outside the proved privacy view.
- **Assurance.** The repository contains formal proofs, tests, reproducible
  builds, internal review, and finalized chain evidence, but it has not
  received an external cryptographic or Solana security audit.

The [paper](paper/aspis-spend/) states the construction and security claims in
full.

## How the transaction works

The 75,358-byte V5 proof is too large for a Solana transaction packet, so it
is uploaded to a temporary program-owned account and sealed before use. The V5
lifecycle comprised 84 transactions:

- 2 pool setup transactions;
- 1 proof-account create;
- 79 proof uploads;
- 1 Tag-62 seal; and
- 1 Tag-67 verify-and-apply transaction.

Deployment and the three cleanup transactions are separate from that count.
During Tag 67, the proof account is read-only and retained so the result can be
recorded before a separate authorized close. The pool and canonical nullifier
are writable. Validation and complete proof verification precede every state
write.

[How Aspis works](docs/how-it-works.md) explains the statement, upload
lifecycle, atomic state transition, and cleanup in plain language.

## Reproduce the evidence

### 1. Check the mathematical Lean development

```bash
cd AspisFormal
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

### 2. Replay the selected Rust-to-Lean proofs

From the repository root:

```bash
aeneas-verif/component-c-runtime-downstream/released-trace-families-current-20260722/replay-lean432.sh
aeneas-verif/current-source-abc-capstone-20260722/replay-lean432.sh
```

The [Aeneas replay notes](aeneas-verif/README.md#replaying-the-final-integration)
describe the authenticated dependency caches and pinned tool locations.

### 3. Check the exact program and frozen release inputs

```bash
./release/aspis-v5-tag67-frozen-candidate-v1/verify.sh
```

For a byte-for-byte rebuild, follow the pinned source, Agave, platform-tools,
and provenance record in the
[V5 release preflight](release/preflight/v5-production-freeze.md).

### 4. Check the finalized mainnet lifecycle

```bash
./release/aspis-v5-tag67-mainnet-v1/verify.sh
python3 tools/check_release_facts.py
```

These checks are offline. They verify the published proof and statement,
frozen SBF reference, lifecycle receipts, compute values, cleanup accounting,
and public release claims against the committed manifests and hashes.
