# R16 soundness preservation obligations

Date: 2026-09-20. Base privacy revision `1d77761f`.

The raw C1 privacy separator is not evidence of a soundness break. However,
R16 changes the encoding/verification relation and must not inherit a
soundness verdict solely because honest fixtures pass.

## What follows from the reversible map

At the algebraic model level, `transportEquiv` supplies both inverses of T.
For any encoder E on the complete message space, `range(E ∘ T) = range(E)`:
one inclusion applies E to Tm, the other chooses `T⁻¹m`. Thus this basis
change does not itself enlarge the ambient codebook or change the set of
codewords on which distance/list bounds are stated. This is a mathematical
consequence, not a compiled end-to-end soundness theorem or a statement
that all such messages satisfy the payment relation.

Original semantic messages and constraints must continue to refer to
`m = T⁻¹c`, where c is the extracted encoded coefficient vector. The
required functional identity is `dot(w,m) = dot(T⁻ᵀw,c)`. It must hold for
arbitrary maliciously supplied c, not merely honestly produced witnesses.
M31/QM31 basis tests and the staged dense differential checks exercise this
identity; its exact-source universal formal refinement remains open.

## Required source gates, none waived

| Gate | Checked evidence | Remaining proposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed public transform | Source-derived immutable order; legal-cell assertions; inverse tests; generic Lean equivalence | Concrete Rust loops/field operations refine that equivalence |
| Joint commitment extraction | Both C1 and C2 use the same T; ordinary encoder and Merkle verification retained | Binding/extraction for the new profile yields a coherent c for every batched column |
| Original semantic relation | Ten-round semantic code remains on original rows; honest public-byte verification passes | Accepted point claims equal evaluations of T⁻¹c except for an explicitly bounded bad event |
| Functional transport | Inverse dual precedes chord transpose; dense and entrywise calculations agree in controls | Universal exact-source dual/chord identity and batching bounds |
| Quotient/image condition | Existing top-coefficient checks and verifier image terminal retained | Extracted quotient satisfying new functional checks corresponds to the same encoded polynomial, including all exceptional OOD cases |
| Final values/openings | Existing authenticated openings and structured/dense outcome comparison retained | Full extraction and consistency theorem through all folds and Final256 |
| Fiat–Shamir chronology | Distinct R16 profile absorbed by prover and verifier; exact map included in descriptor | Source oracle transcript, challenge distribution, query budget and soundness loss for this profile |
| Invalid proofs | Both exercised witnesses accept; byte-corruption/truncation controls reject | Quantified malicious-prover soundness, not a finite mutation sample |

The first soundness-specific source theorem is the universal transported
functional identity for the exact verifier weights, composed with the
existing chord transpose and original point/inactive claims. The wider
commitment/extraction and Fiat–Shamir obligations still need their own
premises and loss accounting. The new profile changes transcript bytes;
old challenges or old proof bytes cannot be assumed identical.

There is no current full soundness-preservation claim, no full privacy
claim, and no release/deployment approval. Closing either ledger alone is
insufficient for the user's full-repair goal.
