# Part 50: native simulator continuation

**Target not yet established.** Branch `codex/cx-prover-commit50-20261022`.
Authorized Lean budget: J10200–J10299 only. Work proceeds through the six
interfaces in part 49, stopping at native payload equality, before any
FSExperiments conversion or joins.

## Frozen inputs and scope

Task base is recorded in `evidence/prover-commit50-20261022/pins/revision.txt`
under `docs/research/100bit-spend-path-20261013/`. No shipped file is changed.
Retained release ELF pins: default 40dc7574…, devnet 12cb0bc2…, Pool 121f3e29….
No fresh ELF build is claimed. Shipped code is never extracted by Aeneas;
independent owners and native transition gates provide the binding route.

## Endpoint before/after

The entire deployed endpoint is preserved verbatim in `endpoint/before.lean.txt`
and `endpoint/after.lean.txt` in this task's evidence. The snapshots are identical.
`RustProverRefinement` remains an explicit premise, with unchanged x/rust
quantifiers, failure event, conclusion and bound. No premise removal is claimed.

## Validation

Focused Lean targets run only on the build host, one module per attempt.
All host tools use MemoryHigh=6G, MemoryMax=8G, MemorySwapMax=0, TasksMax=64;
Rust uses four jobs, release optimization, and
`RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-Wl,--threads=4'`.
Exact source hashes, dependency fingerprints, target/status/wall/RSS/swaps,
source attribution and printed axioms are retained per attempt.
