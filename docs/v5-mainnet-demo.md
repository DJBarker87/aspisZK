# V5 mainnet result

On 25 July 2026 in Europe/Berlin (24 July UTC), the current Aspis release
completed its private-spend verification and state update on Solana
mainnet-beta. To our knowledge, following a public-evidence search completed
on 24 August 2026, this is the first publicly evidenced Solana mainnet
transaction to directly verify a transparent, computationally hiding
private-spend proof and atomically record its nullifier and new pool state
within the transaction compute limit. In that transaction, the program:

- ran the deployed verifier's complete proof-checking path and accepted the
  75,358-byte proof;
- advanced the pool from sequence zero to sequence one; and
- recorded the public nullifier as spent, so later transactions using that
  nullifier are rejected.

The transaction consumed 1,334,452 of Solana's 1,400,000-unit transaction
limit. It finalized successfully at slot `435019536`:
[`EJviPgF…R3vJ2fE`](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/EJviPgF12i9iK2CveVaQSMeFQqDMFPQ1iPRUYEwNQE3zGquTUZNJXPZEENorcQtsnQj1orFmH1TPsgdbR3vJ2fE?cluster=mainnet-beta).

## The evidence behind the transaction

The transaction is the observed final stage of a longer documented path:

| Layer | What is recorded |
| --- | --- |
| Mathematical model | Lean checks spend-witness extraction, the concrete domains and encoders, coherent four-fold extraction, the exact query law, fold duality, hiding and theft reductions, state semantics, and the finite security experiment |
| Selected deployed Rust | Functional translation and Lean proofs connect every successful release execution through the transcript, openings, low-degree test, algebraic relation, and both final accumulators |
| Compiled program | Pinned source and build tools reproduce the exact Solana program byte for byte |
| Mainnet execution | Program identity, exact proof, finalized state transition, compute use, and account changes are recorded below |

The accessible coverage explanation is
[What has been formally checked](formal-verification.md). The release-specific
toolchain, source hashes, replay commands, historical release theorem, and
post-release formal-status boundaries are bound in
[`formal-evidence.json`](../release/aspis-v5-tag67-mainnet-v1/formal/formal-evidence.json).

The frozen SBF was deployed in
[`RHt7eEr…Ndp3RMf`](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/RHt7eErpgLvc7Z2QDWVSj4dmYTg9s4bU62CgWfN5Y1N2BUkAMmQ1V3P8RhtpX9px7aUfAYa8CNSo5Rx5Ndp3RMf?cluster=mainnet-beta)
at slot `434999519`. The finalized state transition is
[`EJviPgF…R3vJ2fE`](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/EJviPgF12i9iK2CveVaQSMeFQqDMFPQ1iPRUYEwNQE3zGquTUZNJXPZEENorcQtsnQj1orFmH1TPsgdbR3vJ2fE?cluster=mainnet-beta).

The exact signed wire simulated at 1,334,452 CU and landed at exactly
1,334,452 CU. The nullifier PDA bump was 255. The recorded pre-execution runner
source required that value to stay within the measured compute policy, but the
immutable lifecycle evidence does not pin the exact executed runner commit.
The exact deployed program derived the PDA from the nullifier and checked the
supplied address, but did not itself require the numeric bump to be 255; that
source check was added later. This affects the compute-policy description, not
the validity of the accepted proof or same-nullifier replay protection.

The proof account and ProgramData were closed after the spend. They can no
longer be read from live account state. The
[full payer RPC archive](../release/aspis-v5-tag67-mainnet-rpc-archive-v1/)
preserves all 1,570 finalized transactions. Its offline verifier reconstructs
the exact 75,358-byte proof from the 79 uploads and the exact 1,258,496-byte
SBF from the loader writes, and both match the released files. It also binds
the released statement to the deployed V5 instruction encoding and pool
initialization.

The exact archived proof separately passes the released verifier callback in
`programs/aspis-verifier/tests/v5_mainnet_release_proof.rs`; changing any of
the nine public fields makes that replay fail. This byte-level regression test
complements the end-to-end accepted-path theorem by fixing the exact published
proof and statement instance.

## Transaction count

The V5 spend lifecycle comprised 84 transactions:

| Phase | Transactions |
| --- | ---: |
| Pool create and initialize | 2 |
| Proof-account create | 1 |
| Proof uploads, up to 960 bytes per chunk | 79 |
| Proof seal | 1 |
| V5 verify and apply | 1 |
| **Total** | **84** |

This count did not change during the run. The earlier demonstration's figure
of 71 covered only its proof-account setup: one creation, 69 uploads, and one
finalization. It excluded that release's two pool transactions and its spend.
The current proof is larger, so it required ten more upload chunks, and the
current total also uses the broader end-to-end lifecycle count. Program
deployment and the three post-execution cleanup transactions are separate.

The resumed V5 lifecycle finalized every write it submitted. Earlier
unsuccessful V5 candidate-wire attempts did not produce failed on-chain
spend transactions. The successful deployment and cleanup transactions are
accounted separately.

## Cleanup and refund

After the V5 verification transaction was finalized and recorded, cleanup proceeded in three finalized
transactions:

| Action | Finalized transaction | Slot | CU | Fee | Value moved |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Close retained proof account | [`5FF19Ec…71hZXbW`](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/5FF19EceNFBVbrNzvhxTnbK8bWSysAHVLRjbfggamY3YSeUFzdk54c4GT9GKitBWGkntNG2Zx9xHgbzp371hZXbW?cluster=mainnet-beta) | `435019649` | 781 | 10,000 lamports | 525,660,961 lamports to the payer |
| Close ProgramData | [`uZ6q5a2…kBdHkWn`](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/uZ6q5a2jGYcscEZgnLghPrqNwp9Hxq3REgYmt6gnb3JuorkUUEQUeJkVWy2e88j9bSLHgRvT2DytjRW2kBdHkWn?cluster=mainnet-beta) | `435019804` | 2,520 | 10,000 lamports | 9,049,204,080 lamports directly to the pinned recipient |
| Sweep payer | [`4haJ6dP…zbj1JyUW`](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4haJ6dPmSFkscFKC57QoCUUcf46vU77av9Y8UfcRyCWjfydzHjCeJCsfuthmifXJfVWreZZM8JTDUdBgzbj1JyUW?cluster=mainnet-beta) | `435020068` | 150 | 5,000 lamports | 1,931,690,802 lamports to the pinned recipient |

The release used a locally pinned configured refund recipient. It received
9,049,204,080 + 1,931,690,802 = **10,980,894,882 lamports**
(10.980894882 SOL). The proof-account rent first returned to the payer and is
therefore already included in the later payer sweep; it must not be added to
the recipient total a second time. The payer's finalized post-sweep balance
was zero.

The cleanup path pins the refund address independently of mutable account
balances. The ProgramData refund went directly to that address. The final
sweep signed an exact payer-balance snapshot minus its transaction fee, so
unrelated inbound lamports could not redirect the refund.

The earlier demonstration and its different lifecycle are preserved
unchanged in [the historical mainnet record](mainnet-demo.md). Machine-readable
release identities and measurements are in
[`release/release-facts.json`](../release/release-facts.json). The sanitized
proof, statement, finalized lifecycle receipts, and reconciliation are in the
offline-verifiable
[`release/aspis-v5-tag67-mainnet-v1/`](../release/aspis-v5-tag67-mainnet-v1/)
bundle; run its
[`verify.sh`](../release/aspis-v5-tag67-mainnet-v1/verify.sh) from the
repository checkout. Then run
`python3 release/aspis-v5-tag67-mainnet-rpc-archive-v1/verify.py` to reproduce
the historical proof and SBF reconstruction.
